# DeepSync
DeepSync  is the first on-chain analytics platform built on Walrus && Sui, Mysten Labs' decentralized storage protocol. Unlike platforms such as Dune Analytics and Nansen that serve investors with market alpha, cash flow tracking, and protocol assessments, DeepSync focuses directly on Web3 projects, providing data insights and tools to accelerate project growth.
